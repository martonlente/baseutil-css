# Baseutil CSS
Baseutil CSS is a modern, fully flexible, and utility-centric  desktop-first framework, designed to help you in streamlined custom web development. It's built on the idea to have a modest set of variable-based base styles for grid and type, and a rich set of also variable-based single-responsibility utilities. :triangular_ruler:
